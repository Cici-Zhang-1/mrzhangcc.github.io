<p>Today, I will participate a test on 3-Hour Alcohol and Drug Education Test of Maryland again. This is for getting driver license of Maryland. I said again because I had done this about one and half year ago, but the certificate was expired few month ago. You may want to know why this happened? Because I have one year duration to get my driver license. Yes, you are right, I have procrastination.</p>
<p>In my last year』s plan list, I had made a decision to pass the test, but I failed to finish it. I always found a excuse to not do it all the time. Now I have to re-do what I have did before. Such behavior has brought me huge losses.</p>
<h3 id="1-Time"><a href="#1-Time" class="headerlink" title="1. Time"></a>1. Time</h3><p>As I have got my driver license when I was in China. Now in order to be able to drive here. I have to spend time on researching how to to it and what the whole flow is. Then I followed the steps. First, I have to study online at least 3 hours on Alcohol and Drug Education and then pass the related test. Then I need to study traffic laws in order to pass the law test. When I participated the law test, I went three times to the MVA. It really took me a long time.</p>
<h3 id="2-Money"><a href="#2-Money" class="headerlink" title="2. Money"></a>2. Money</h3><p>When I first took the exam, I almost spend two hundred dollars on it which includes test fee and transportation fee. As we did not have a car, every time I went to the MVA to take the knowledge test, I have to take Uber or Lyft.</p>
<h3 id="3-Vigor"><a href="#3-Vigor" class="headerlink" title="3. Vigor"></a>3. Vigor</h3><p>Each time you have to study online. So you have to spend vigor on it. Otherwise, you can not pass the test.</p>
<h3 id="4-Opportunity"><a href="#4-Opportunity" class="headerlink" title="4. Opportunity"></a>4. Opportunity</h3><p>At the begin of this year, I decided to leave the restaurant which I have worked for one year and to find another job which is related my major. I was very glad I found one soon. But there is a problem, the company is too far from my home. As the public transportation is not as mature as China, I can not arrive there by the public transportation. I did not have a car. I even did not have the driver license. Then how can I find the next job without a car?</p>
<p>I have never calculated gains or losses on my procrastination. But today, when I am thinking carefully, I am very shocked. In China, there is a saying: You Always Give Up Halfway. I do not want to be such a man.</p>
